## Activities

##### 2016.12.10
I have a meeting with my partners to discuss about the all 208 requirements. Understand them and classify them into different types. There are some repeated and useless requirement, we found out and abandoned them. 

##### 2016.12.11-2016.12.17
After reading the **Course Discussion Forum on the itslearning**. I summaried and list some methods that can be optional for my release planning.
I got the following references and understood the principles of each methods.

#### Tools that I finally seclect.
###### MoSCOW 
MoSCoW is a fairly simple way to sort features (or requirement) into priority order – a way to help teams quickly understand the customer's view of what is essential for launch and what is not. Each requirement within a group shares the same priority : Must have, Should have ,
Could have and Won't have.

#### Theme-based release planning
 Theme-based Product Release Planning is a method that helps the project manager to tap hidden business opportunities by releasing highly interdependent features together. The approach favors delivering specific theme-oriented products in each release, as opposed to releasing generic products. 

##### 2016.12.18-2016.12.23
Understand the specification of Project. 
And analyze the viewpoints of different role of the involvers of the project such as Teacher, Student, Admin and Developer.
Draw the Roadmap and set the release for different goals.
Assign the type of requirement to the release to achieve the goal.

##### 2016.12.26-2017.1.3
Prioritize the requirements through MoSCoW.
And describe the detailed activities for each release.

##### 2017.1.4-2017.1.9


Define the source that need for each release.

##### 2017.1.9-2017.1.11
Document the release planning report and upload to GITHUB.


### Challenge

For there are some strange methods and words, I feels it hard to implement the methods. 
For example, I don't know how to build a right roadmap, how to set release for the RP and so on.
I assume and come up with some ideas, and learned from the success cases. I improved and bettered my solutions.
