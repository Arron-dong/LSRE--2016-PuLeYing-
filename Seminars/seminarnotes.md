Article "The Art and Science of Software Release Planning" 
This parper introduce two approaches to release planning. The first one is the art of RP approach depends on human activitis like intuition, communication and capabilities to negotiate between constraints and conflicting ojectives. The other one is science of RP which through analyzing the problem and applyng suitable algorithms to build the best soulution. The author hope to create a synergy between the both.
There are some difficulties of creating a release plan :1.Understanding of the planning objectives, constraints, stakeholders and feature preferences. 2. The planning scope is limited to the next release. 3.The project management includes many steps, how to perform the process effectively and efficiently is a challenge.
Later, the author introduce some essential part of RP which we have to consider by some equations. 1.Decision variables 2.Dependencies between features 3.Resource constraints 4.Stakeholders 5.Feature prioritization 6.Objective function
At last, the author comes up with a hybrid approach based on integer linear programming. There are several phases. Phase1:Modeling (including a.Plan objectives and constraints b.Offer stakeholder voting. c.Estimate resources.)  Phase2: Exploration Phase3:Consolidation

Article "A Case Study Evaluation of the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements" 
This is the parper through a case study to evaluate QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements.
QUPER Model aims to support high-level decision-making in release planning of quality requirements. The author points the steps of Step1: Identify candidate QR. It refers that when we define QR, we have to consider relevent features, niche market, competitors, and the hardware platform.
Step2: Define scale and unit. It means that a scale and a measurement unit can be used to help us express the level of QR.
Step3: Identify reference levels. It is based on actual products and help further calibrate QR's estimaiton and objective measures.
Step4: Elicit quality breakpoints.
Step5: Estimate cost barriers. It recommands that identify 2 similar quality requirements from other projects as input, for one is mainly related to software changes and the other is related to hardware components.
Step6: Set candidate requirements
