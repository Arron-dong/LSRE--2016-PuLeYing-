### Article: “What Happened to Our Features? Visualization and Understanding of Scope Change Dynamics in a Large-Scale Industrial Setting”


The background of this article is that when we develop software platform, decision on which features to implement are affected by many factors. For this article, the author through an industrial case study in a large-scale setting where a technique called a Feature Survival Charts has been implemented and evaluated. The technique that the author mentions can help spot the problem of setting too large scope compared to available resources and increase the understanding of early set a limited range of consequences.

The case company, which is chosen, has more than 5000 staffs and develops systems for a global market. The method that the author used is FSC chart and tracking corresponding scope was used in an interactive manner that included practitioners from the company. The author analyzed a particular project include a. The length of analyzed project b. The number of features considered in the scope of project c. The possibility of visualizing and analyzing major changes in the scope of the project. 

In the following content, the author presents several FSCs that X-axis shows the scope changes over time which is illustrated, Y-axis shows each feature that positioned on a specific place. And with the help of FSC, we can have a starting point to figure out why the decision were made and enable definition of measurements. 

As a conclusion, the visualization technique can provide feedback about the ongoing scoping and visualization of past project scoping activities. Then the measurements are taken to complement this technique by quantitative characterization and qualitative rationale for scoping decisions. Through this method, we can present a better overview of the scoping process of the whole project on a single page size graph.[3]

As Karlsson has said that software engineers and managers need real-time feedback to improve construction techniques and products in ongoing projects. In the same way, organizations can use the process of improving future projects for post autopsy feedback. [1] The technique can really help us make Visualization and Understanding of Scope Change Dynamics in a large-scale requirement engineering

### Article: “Obsolete Software Requirements”
  
  
  As we know that, under the environment that requirements change rapidly, obsolete software requirements appear commonly, we usually choose to not address them. But there is very limited research about the nature of obsolete software requirement and their role in the requirement management. So, the author chose an empirical investigation to have a deeper investigation of obsolete software requirements.
 The method that used includes several RQs which could help us early understand and summary. 
  
  From the study, that respondents defined 

1. OSR as a software requirement that is no longer needed for the current or future releases. 
2. Most of the respondents consider that the phenomenon of OSRs is serious.
3. When talking about the type of requirement that affect the likelihood of a software requirement to be obsolete. The answer is that Requirements related to standards and laws are the least while 
inconsistent and ambiguous requirements are the most likely to become obsolete
4. Identifying OSRs is usually a manual activity.
5. Most of respondents are willing to kept the OSRs instead of deleting them.
6. And as a research result, OSRs are more likely to affect large scale requirements and very large-scale requirement projects.
7. When it talks about where in the requirements should OSRs be handled : First of all is the most popular answer.

For studying this paper, I have understood a concept in the requirement engineering: OSR. 

From reading another article about OSR[2], the author has the similar result and explains that requirements changes are unavoidable in software projects and The outcome of his research confirms that the phenomenon of OSRs does exist in reality. Different people working in different environments may have different opinions about OSRs, so the personal research result could be different. For example, there is a gap between one side: academicians, researchers and the other side: software engineers and requirements specialists. Only 1(0.5%) academician or researcher recognizes OSRs in his Requirement Engineering process.
