2.Software release planning: an evolutionary and iterative approach"

3."Value-Oriented Requirements Prioritization in a Small Development Organization"

4."Choosing the “Right Prioritization Method"

5."Can we beat the complexity of very large-scale requirements engineering?"

And I also read the previous literatures which include the methods or techniques during the course seminar.

#### 2016.12.26-2017.1.2
Select the Article 1 "Requirements prioritization in on-line banking systems: using value-oriented framework" and "Article 4 Choosing the “Right” Prioritization Method

Understand and do the implementation planning for the both methods.


#### 2017.1.2-2017.1.9
Implement the Value-oriented framework method and MoSCoW method into the part of requirement of the 208 Course Management System requirements.

And write the lesson learned from the implementation and find some other references about the LSRE and some comments about the techniques.

Later, write the reflection and I learn from this assignment.
